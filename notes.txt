                NOTES:
--------------------------------------

Issues:
- Tail gets replaced with new body and new tail is formed

Example:
[ 
    0: { 
            coordinate: '',
            direction: ''
    }
]

I hate this north east etc I did, angles are easier to work with
Need to implement game over and reset when pressing play, again.

Added snake length increasing after eating fruit however visuals are affected and causes issues around 7 points (when length is 10).

Found more issues, snake speeding up?
